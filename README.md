### Description
  - URL: www.usfkcorona.com
  - a web-service designed to digitize the USFK 549th Hospital's COVID-19 Response 
  - the web-service was designed and deployed during my military service in 549th Hospital as the hospital's linguist and translator, later received the Army Commendation Medal for honorable service

### Objective
  - the website provides major features including real-time COVID-19 case updates in United States and Korea, self-assessment questionnaire utilized to assist the patient, hotspot tracker within the USFK garrisons / camps, and contact information of hospital and KCDA
